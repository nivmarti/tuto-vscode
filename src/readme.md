"But in order that you may see whence comes all this born error of those
 who accuse pleasure and praise pain, I will open the whole matter, and 
 I will explain the very things which were said by that discoverer of truth and, 
 as it were, the architect of a happy life. great sorrows result to those who
  do not know how to pursue pleasure with reason. Nor is there anyone who loves pain 
  because it is pain, pursues it, wants to gain it, but because such times never 
  occur when he seeks some great pleasure through labor and pain. For I will come 
  to the smallest , who of us undertakes any laborious exercise of the body, 
  except in order that some benefit may result from it?or he who shuns pain, 
  that in which no pleasure is born?"
